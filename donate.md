Being an altruist is tough.

Releasing my open-source programs for free, with no fee required for downloading, while making sure that my publicly-available code remains accessible, open, and usable by all requires significant time and effort on the part of myself. Doing it all for free can be very tough, considering that I am essentially *giving away my code*, for free, under very license terms such as the BSD and LGPL licenses. It serves as a way to be transparent, a source of help for new programmers or those struggling, and lets me give back to the open-source community, which has contributed so much over the years.

I invest a lot of time into making sure that my open-source code can be used by users. Heck, I even provide [free support](/contact.html). Therefore, I ask that if you have benefited from my work, or if it has saved you time and/or money, that you please donate to help keep development going. For $3-$5, or any amount, you help contribute to my work and you help keep these programs free, open, and accessible to all for another year. After all, if the price of a cup of Starbucks coffee helps to get you helpful programs, why not donate?

You can find donation links at the bottom of every page on the website and on most project pages. Thanks so much!
