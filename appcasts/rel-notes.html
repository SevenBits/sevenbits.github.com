        <h2>Version 2.0 Release Notes</h2>

        <p>Mac Linux USB Loader version 2.0 is a groundbreaking release, shipping with the revolutionary new boot loader Enterprise, making it even easier to make Linux boot from USB drives on Macs. Even better, it requires zero configuration! Just load up Mac Linux USB Loader and pop in a supported distribution and you're good to go!</p>

        <p>Here's a list of changes that are in this release:
        <ul>
            <li>Added a traditional Chinese language support (done  by a third party), and updated Spanish support.</li>
            <li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
            <li>Added support for Ubuntu 13.10 and Elementary OS Luna.</li>
            <li>Better detection of valid mountable drives.</li>
            <li>Slightly tweaked graphical user interface.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>My custom bootloader, Enterprise, did not make it in time for this release. I will be issuing an update when it is ready. There is an option in the Firmware Options panel to set Enterprise as the preferred bootloader, so you'll have your preferences all set when the final version does ship!</p>

        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>The number one requested feature: support for Tails and Kali Linux, is coming along, but not offically supported yet.
        </p>

        <p>That's about it for now. Click the Install and Relaunch button to start using Mac Linux USB Loader version 2.0!</p>

        <h3>Roadmap</h3>

                <li>Removing the current bootx64.efi file and replacing it with my own, custom solution.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>That's about it for now. Click the Install and Relaunch button to start using Mac Linux USB Loader version 1.1!</p>
