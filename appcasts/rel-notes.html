        <h2>Version 1.0 Release Notes</h2>
        
        <p>Thank you for using Mac Linux USB Loader. I know it's been a while since I've announced the 1.0 release preview, and I know it's been pushed off
        several times, but I thank you for your patience in waiting for the release. It's been a while, I know, but 1.0 is very much worth it.</p>
        
        <p>You'll find the following changes have occured in the software since my initial beta release:
        	<ul>
            	<li>Improved user interface that is stable and not buggy.</li>
                <li>A distribution downloader has been added to automatically download Ubuntu at the click of a mouse.</li>
                <li>You can erase your USB drives from the main screen; it is no longer required to open an ISO first.</li>
                <li>The preferences window has been totally revamped and is now using the excellent RHPreferences framework.</li>
                <li>It is now easier than ever to create a live USB drive of Linux for Macs!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>The future will be a bright one. Here are some things I'm shooting for for future releases:
        	<ul>
            	<li>Integration with <a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Enterprise" target="_new">Enterprise</a>, my custom UEFI boot loader.</li>
                <li>Removing the current bootx64.efi file and replacing it with my own, custom solution.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>That's about it for now. Click the Install & Relaunch button to start using 1.0!</p>
