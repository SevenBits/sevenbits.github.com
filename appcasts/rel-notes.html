		  <h2>Version 2.0.2 Release Notes</h2>

		  <p>Howdy, folks.</p>
		  <p>This is basically a small little update to Mac Linux USB Loader. It doesn't include any new features or fix any major bugs; rather, it is meant to be a release to tide you all over until the rewrite comes out.</p>

		  <p>The official changelog is rather unimpressive:
		  <ul>
			  <li>The USB drive blesser shows a custom authorization request message rather than the bland default message</li>
			  <li>Added a Greek translation, courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/Mitsos101">@Mitsos101</a> and other minor localization fixes</li>
			  <li>Updated the distribution downloader to have updated ISOs for Linux Mint and Zorin OS</li>
			  <li>Updated the project to use the OS X 10.10 SDK and updated some included frameworks</li>
			  <li>The version number in the About window is now set dynamically</li>
		  </ul>
		  </p>

		  <h3>Roadmap</h3>
		  <p>The rewrite is coming along, everyone. I've been getting many emails about it; rest assured, it is coming!
		  </p>

		  <p>That's about it for now. Click the Install and Relaunch button to start using Mac Linux USB Loader version 2.0.2!</p>

        <h2>Version 2.0 Release Notes</h2>

        <p>Mac Linux USB Loader version 2.0 is a groundbreaking release, shipping with the revolutionary new boot loader Enterprise, making it even easier to make Linux boot from USB drives on Macs. Even better, it requires zero configuration! Just load up Mac Linux USB Loader and pop in a supported distribution and you're good to go!</p>
        <p>Please note that you may need to download the update manually. If you're upgrading from the version 2.0 beta, you should be fine.</p>

        <p>Here's a list of changes that are in this release:
        <ul>
            <li>Added a traditional Chinese language support (done  by a third party), and updated Spanish support.</li>
            <li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
            <li>Added support for Ubuntu 13.10 and Elementary OS Luna.</li>
            <li>Better detection of valid mountable drives.</li>
            <li>Slightly tweaked graphical user interface.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>The number one requested feature: support for Tails and Kali Linux, is coming along, but not offically supported yet.
        </p>

        <p>That's about it for now. Click the Install and Relaunch button to start using Mac Linux USB Loader version 2.0!</p>

        <h2>Version 1.1 Release Notes</h2>
        
        <p>Mac Linux USB Loader version 1.1 is mainly a bug fix release. Thanks to the many users who have taken the time to point out and report bugs, as well as suggest ideas for new features.</p>
        
          <p>Here's a list of changes that are in this release:
        	<ul>
            	<li>Fixed a issue where Mac Linux USB Loader would crash after downloading a Linux distribution from the Download Distribution panel.</li>
                <li>Fixed some issues regarding the progress bar in the installation window incorrectly reporting the file copy progress.</li>
                <li>You can now close Mac Linux USB Loader's main window; clicking the Dock icon will bring it back.</li>
                <li>Added an option on the main menu screen to "bless" a USB drive created with Mac Linux USB Loader, allowing to boot up automatically.</li>
                <li>Added a Firmware Options section in the Preferences window, allowing you to customize options allowing you to choose which firmware to install.</li>
                <li>Updated Spanish localizations of user interface elements.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
          
        <p>My custom bootloader, Enterprise, did not make it in time for this release. I will be issuing an update when it is ready. There is an option in the Firmware Options panel to set Enterprise as the preferred bootloader, so you'll have your preferences all set when the final version does ship!</p>
        
        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>The future will be a bright one. Here are some things I'm shooting for for future releases:
        	<ul>
            	<li>Integration with <a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Enterprise" target="_new">Enterprise</a>, my custom UEFI boot loader.</li>
                <li>Removing the current bootx64.efi file and replacing it with my own, custom solution.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>That's about it for now. Click the Install and Relaunch button to start using Mac Linux USB Loader version 1.1!</p>
