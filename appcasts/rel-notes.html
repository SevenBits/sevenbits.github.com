                <h2>Version 3.0 Release Notes</h2>
                <p>I am pleased to announce to world that the Mac Linux USB Loader rewrite is officially ready to be released as version 3.0! It features brand new, never-before-seen features in <em>any</em> live USB creator for Mac, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An improved Enterprise boot manager, containing fixes for many common errors, including the dreaded "booting in blind mode"</li>
                    <li>A brand-new user interface, which is much easier to use and more Mac-like</li>
                    <li>Persistence support for Ubuntu-based distributions: setup persistence on your USB drive to save data between runs</li>

                <p>That's about it. Thank you for your patience.</p>
                <h2>Version 2.0.2 Release Notes</h2>
                <p>Howdy, folks.</p>
                <p>This is basically a small little update to Mac Linux USB Loader. It doesn't include any new features or fix any major bugs; rather, it is meant to be a release to tide you all over until the rewrite comes out.</p>
                <p>The official changelog is rather unimpressive:
                <ul>
                    <li>The USB drive blesser shows a custom authorization request message rather than the bland default message</li>
                    <li>Added a Greek translation, courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/Mitsos101">@Mitsos101</a> and other minor localization fixes</li>
                    <li>Updated the distribution downloader to have updated ISOs for Linux Mint and Zorin OS</li>
                    <li>Updated the project to use the OS X 10.10 SDK and updated some included frameworks</li>
                    <li>The version number in the About window is now set dynamically</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Roadmap</h3>
                <p>The rewrite is coming along, everyone. I've been getting many emails about it; rest assured, it is coming!
                </p>
                <p>That's about it for now. Click the Install and Relaunch button to start using Mac Linux USB Loader version 2.0.2!</p>

                <h2>Version 2.0 Release Notes</h2>

                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Roadmap</h3>
                <p>The number one requested feature: support for Tails and Kali Linux, is coming along, but not offically supported yet.
                </p>

                <h2>Version 1.1 Release Notes</h2>
                <p>Mac Linux USB Loader version 1.1 is mainly a bug fix release. Thanks to the many users who have taken the time to point out and report bugs, as well as suggest ideas for new features.</p>
                <p>Here's a list of changes that are in this release:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed a issue where Mac Linux USB Loader would crash after downloading a Linux distribution from the Download Distribution panel.</li>
                    <li>Fixed some issues regarding the progress bar in the installation window incorrectly reporting the file copy progress.</li>
                    <li>You can now close Mac Linux USB Loader's main window; clicking the Dock icon will bring it back.</li>
                    <li>Added an option on the main menu screen to "bless" a USB drive created with Mac Linux USB Loader, allowing to boot up automatically.</li>
                    <li>Added a Firmware Options section in the Preferences window, allowing you to customize options allowing you to choose which firmware to install.</li>
                    <li>Updated Spanish localizations of user interface elements.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>My custom bootloader, Enterprise, did not make it in time for this release. I will be issuing an update when it is ready. There is an option in the Firmware Options panel to set Enterprise as the preferred bootloader, so you'll have your preferences all set when the final version does ship!</p>
                <h3>Roadmap</h3>
                <p>The future will be a bright one. Here are some things I'm shooting for for future releases:
                <ul>
                    <li>Integration with <a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Enterprise" target="_new">Enterprise</a>, my custom UEFI boot loader.</li>
                    <li>Removing the current bootx64.efi file and replacing it with my own, custom solution.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>That's about it for now. Click the Install and Relaunch button to start using Mac Linux USB Loader version 1.1!</p>
