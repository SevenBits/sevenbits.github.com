SevenBits is the online alias of a unique but somewhat quirky programmer from New Hampshire. He has been coding for years and has many projects to his name. Recalling them all will be a challenge. ;)

He is notable as the developer of a few niche open-source projects that are used by a lot of people around the world. He is the developer of [Mac Linux USB Loader](https://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/), an OS X software program to create Linux bootable USB drives that can boot on a Mac, as well as [Enterprise](https://sevenbits.github.io/Enterprise/), a UEFI boot manager for Intel Macs. In addition, he has a commercial program on the Mac App Store named [Incinerator](https://incinerator.sevenbits.tk), which can securely erase files from a hard drive so that they are unretrievable.

Some of his other interests include WebGL and graphics programming, server-side application development, and kernel/boot loader programming.

If you need anything, feel free to [contact him](/contact.html).
