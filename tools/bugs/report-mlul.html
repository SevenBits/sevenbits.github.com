		<h3>Rules for Reporting Mac Linux USB Loader and Enterprise Bugs</h3>
		<p>
			Thank you for choosing to report a bug in Mac Linux USB Loader or Enterprise. In order to ensure bug reports are clear and understandable, and purvey enough information to allow me to fix the bug, I have established some ground rules for bug reports to ensure that your bug gets cleared in as quickly a matter possible and does not waste anyone's time. Reports that do not follow these rules will be closed:
		</p>
		<div id="advert">
			<ol>
				<li><strong>It is not a bug if the behavior is documented.</strong> To verify that the behavior is not documented, please check <a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/wiki" target="_blank">the Mac Linux USB Loader wiki</a> and the <a href="http://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/" target="_blank">Mac Linux USB Loader</a> and <a href="http://sevenbits.github.io/Enterprise/">Enterprise</a> websites.</li>
				<li>Please make sure that the bug report has not already been filed. You can do that <a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/issues" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Enterprise/issues" target="_blank">here</a>. Be sure to check both open and closed issues. If a similar report has already been filed, <strong>do not file a new report</strong>. Instead, add any new information to the already existing report and, if it is closed, re-open it if necessary.</li>
				<li>Bug reports must be reproducable. You must demonstrate that the bug occurs every time under a specific set of circumstances. You should provide at least an account of exactly what you did leading up to the bug occurring (including switching to other programs, clicking on program notifications, opening a file, etc) but steps to reproduce are appreciated. If the bug reported results in a crash, please post in the report the Apple crash report.</li>
				<li>I need your basic information, like operating system version, version of Mac Linux USB Loader you are using (including if you are using a stable, pre-release or custom/self-compiled build), and how many times this bug has occurred for you before in your knowledge.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			If the bug occurs with <em>creating, configuring, or using Mac Linux USB Loader</em>, file a bug report for Mac Linux USB Loader. If the bug occurs with <em>booting the USB drive</em>, file a bug report for Enterprise.
