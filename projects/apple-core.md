Apple Core is an advanced system tool allowing you to view, and change, internal OS X configuration files. Development is currently on hold due to lack of interest and time in pursuing this further. 

Apple Core is designed for advanced users that want the power to know how their system behaves internally. Casual OS X users need not apply, as there is serious risk of destroying your operating system through incorrect use.

This was written using Objective-C and Cocoa. I wrote it primarily as a program to assist in modifying many OS X system files at once. It also includes (basic) support for compiling Darwin and the (open-source) OS X kernel from Apple. And in case you haven't figured it out, yes, the name is a pun.
