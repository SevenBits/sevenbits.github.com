Greetings fellow netizens!

I am happy to report that I have completed an upgrade of my site, which is now generating content via Jekyll. Pretty amazing, huh?

Jekyll is really cool and makes generating static sites like this one really easy. I haven't transferred everything over yet, but all that will be here very soon, so be patient. ;)

Hopefully, this will be a new evolution of of my World Wide Web presense. *Do svidaniya!*
