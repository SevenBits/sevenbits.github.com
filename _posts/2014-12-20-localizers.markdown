So, you all are probably wondering when [Mac Linux USB Loader][1]'s rewrite will be out. Well, fear not, because it will be out by Christmas, that is, assuming that you all have been good this year. ;)

But there's one thing that I really need right now, and that's people who can help localize Mac Linux USB Loader. Right now, Mac Linux USB Loader supports [a few languages][2], and while that certainly isn't bad, it precludes a lot of people from being able to use it, because it is difficult to use a program in a language that you cannot speak. Even worse is the fact that the rewrite hasn't been translated yet - it's only available in English!

So, this is where I'd like to solicit the help of the community. If you're fluent in a language other than English, and you have a little bit of spare time, I'd appreciate it if could could translate Mac Linux USB Loader into your native language. All you need is some spare time and a Mac or Linux machine (you don't even need Xcode).

If you're interested in helping, please [send me an email][3] with the following information:

- Your name or online alias (so that I can credit you)
- The language that you'd like to translate Mac Linux USB Loader into (you must be fluent enough for an accurate translation)
- How long it will take to translate

Thanks so much. If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me][3].
