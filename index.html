      <h1>Localizers Wanted</h1>
      <p>There's one thing that I really need right now, and that's people who can help translate Mac Linux USB Loader. Right now, Mac Linux USB Loader supports a few languages, but the rewrite hasn't been translated yet - it's only available in English! So, this is where I'd like to solicit the help of the community. If you're fluent in a language other than English, and you have a little bit of spare time, I'd appreciate it if you could could translate Mac Linux USB Loader into your native language.</p>

  <p>I'm SevenBits, and this is my personal website related to all of my work in computer science, specifically, my open&#45;source development work. If you&#39;re reading this, then chances are good that you stumbled onto my little corner of the Internet and are now taking the time to read my site&#39;s description rather than simply jumping straight for what you want, for which I commend you.</p>
  <p>I write software to do things. That&#39;s my perogative. If they say that necessity is the mother of invention, then, well, the nursery is right here.</p>
  <p>I have <a href="http://sevenbits-tech-blog.blogspot.com" target="_blank">a blog</a> where I post occasional rants and raves. You can also view my commercial projects by <a href="/projects/">clicking here</a>.</p>
