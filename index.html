      <h1>Now Accepting Donations</h1>
      <p>I am pleased to announce that I am now accepting donations towards my projects. Using the link below you can send me any amount of money that you wish, and you can even pay by credit card or bank transfer, all completely anonymously.</p>
      <p><strong>Your donations will help keep development of my applications going</strong> and will help to keep them available to everyone.
      <p>If you&#39;ve donated and would like your donation to go to a specific project or task, please <a href="contact.html">email me</a> and let me know.</p>

  <p>I'm SevenBits, and this is my personal website related to all of my work in computer science, specifically, my open&#45;source development work. If you&#39;re reading this, then chances are good that you stumbled onto my little corner of the Internet and are now taking the time to read my site&#39;s description rather than simply jumping straight for what you want, for which I commend you.</p>
  <p>I write software to do things. That&#39;s my perogative. If they say that necessity is the mother of invention, then, well, the nursery is right here.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://sevenbits-tech-blog.blogspot.com" target="_blank">a blog</a> where I post occasional rants and raves. You can also view my commercial projects by <a href="/projects/">clicking here</a>.</p>
