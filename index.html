      <h1>Insane BF Released</h1>
      <p>I am pleased to announce the release of Insane BF, an app designed to make it easy to run Brainfuck code on your Mac. Insane BF ships with a complete execution environment for the esoteric Brainfuck programming language, which was created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller and features everything great about the six command language without requiring a command line.</p>
	  <p>Grab it now at the introductory price of USD$1.99!</p>

  <p>I'm SevenBits, and this is my personal website related to all of my work in computer science, specifically, my open&#45;source development work. If you&#39;re reading this, then chances are good that you stumbled onto my little corner of the Internet and are now taking the time to read my site&#39;s description rather than simply jumping straight for what you want, for which I commend you.</p>
  <p>I write software to do things. That&#39;s my prerogative. If they say that necessity is the mother of invention, then, well, the nursery is right here.</p>
  <p>I have <a href="http://sevenbits-tech-blog.blogspot.com" target="_blank">a blog</a> where I post occasional rants and raves. You can also view my commercial projects by <a href="/projects/">clicking here</a>.</p>
